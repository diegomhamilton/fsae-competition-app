# Operations Prompt

Given this task, approach, and structure:

Task: `10.4 Refactor step metadata layout to avoid wrapping/truncation in compact widths and larger Dynamic Type: show step ID/title/status first, move rule references to a secondary row, and keep the open-step action compact.`

Structure: `<paste structure>`

Decompose this into concrete, reviewable operations.

For each operation, include:

- Exact action
- Expected files or test targets
- Verification command or manual check
- Build ownership: agent-run, user-run, or not applicable
- Manual validation notes to capture when the user will build or inspect locally
- Commit boundary and a proposed commit title of 52 characters or fewer
- Whether the operation can be committed without breaking compilation
- Done condition

Operation-first PR summary:

- Summary: Refactor step metadata layout for compact widths and larger Dynamic Type.
- Scope: StepOverviewView; metadata components; previews/tests
- Notes: Split if rule reference presentation becomes reusable component work.
- Validation: Dynamic Type and compact width checks.

Task-specific operation plan:

1. Inspect OpenSpec context, the feature scenarios, and the current implementation or docs touched by this task.
2. Create or update only the smallest file set needed for TASK#10.4.
3. Add failing Swift Testing coverage before code behavior where applicable. When the task is part of TASK#8 UI automation, use stable identifiers as selectors.
4. Implement or document the operation without mixing unrelated review contexts.
5. Record validation in the PR description using `Summary`, `Scope`, `Notes`, and `Validation`.
6. Split into a task branch if the work exceeds 10 changed files, mixes unrelated domains, or makes review unsafe.

Do not build automatically unless the user explicitly asks. Specify the exact user-run build or inspection signal the user should report back.

When this task becomes a PR, use this title:

`TASK#10.4: Step Metadata Layout`
