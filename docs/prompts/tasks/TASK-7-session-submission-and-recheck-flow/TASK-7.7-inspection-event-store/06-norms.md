# Norms Prompt

Apply the project norms to this task:

Task: `7.7 Implement InspectionEventStore as an actor-isolated event/session source of truth with scoped queries by event, team, session, user access, and the JSON file persistence service.`

Check the proposed work against these norms:

- Start from OpenSpec design and the inspection_event_use_cases.feature file.
- Keep Application Support JSON storage scoped by event, team, session, stage, and test case ID.
- Use Swift Testing for unit and integration checks.
- Use actor isolation for persistence, event-store, and mutable local state boundaries.
- Keep submitted snapshots immutable; corrections flow through rechecks.
- Use task-sized commits and split if the PR crosses more than 10 files or mixes unrelated review contexts.
- Do not claim manual validation unless actual app evidence is recorded.
- Use Swift Testing for unit and integration checks.
- Keep dedicated UI automation in the TASK#8 PR.
- Use stable accessibility identifiers instead of localized labels for UI automation.
- Keep PR titles in the `TASK#7.7: <summary>` format.
- Keep commit titles 52 characters or fewer.
- Keep manual validation honest: `not run` is better than unsupported claims.

Return any adjustments needed before implementation.

Expected PR title:

`TASK#7.7: Inspection Event Store`
